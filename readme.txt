== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get an API key for use with Last FM? =

Use the following URL: http://www.last.fm/api/account/create

= Where can I get support for the plugin? =

Support is primarily available on [Kieran O'Shea's forum](http://www.kieranoshea.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=15 "Kieran O'Shea's forum").
A wealth of questions and answers are available here along with a copy of this FAQ. The support forum is located away from WordPress because
at the time the original plugin was authored, the WordPress support forums didn't provide an easy way to be notified of posts and manage things.
Recently things have changed in this regard and so the WordPress support forums for Last FM are also monitored from time to time.

= Where can I request a feature? =

Please use the support forums mentioned above, adding your request to the feature requests thread
